// 4. Preprocessing directives are executed, macro invocations are expanded, and
// _Pragma unary operator expressions are executed. If a character sequence that
// matches the syntax of a universal character name is produced by token
// concatenation (6.10.3.3), the behavior is undefined. A #include preprocessing
// directive causes the named header or source file to be processed from phase 1
// through phase 4, recursively. All preprocessing directives are then deleted.
